/**
 * In this class simplified subclasses of the RBEvaluation and
 * RBConstruction class are introduced.
 *
 * RBSimpleEvaluation: requires only the definition of the lower coercivity
 * constant. The value is here specified for a Conduction problem.
 *
 * RBSimpleConstruction: In order to construct the RB System with the
 * RBSimpleEvaluation subclass the method build_rb_evaluation needs to be
 * overriden.
 *
 * NOTE: ENSURE THAT THE CLASS IS INHERITING FROM THE CORRECT RBSTRUCTURES.
